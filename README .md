This is the second project where we have to make Registration form Using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
# Project Title: "Registration-Form"
## Description
HTML code is a registration form with input fields for the username, email, and password. It also has a "Submit" button to trigger the form submission. The CSS code is used to style the form and the JavaScript code contains the logic for validating the form data.

## How code works
1) When the "Submit" button is clicked, the validateForm() function is called.
2) The function checks if any of the input fields are empty. If any of them are, an alert message is displayed to the user, asking them to fill in all fields.
3) If all the fields are filled in, an alert message is displayed to the user, confirming the successful registration and displaying the username and email provided by the user.

In the CSS code, the flexbox layout is used to center the form vertically and horizontally. The background gradient color, box shadow, and other styles are applied to enhance the visual appeal of the form.
